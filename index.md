We are delighted to announce that Segfault Systems is joining
[Tarides](https://tarides.com/). Segfault has worked closely with Tarides over
the last couple of years, most notably on the award-winning [Multicore
OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore)
project and the upstreaming plans for OCaml 5.0. This alliance furthers the
goals of Tarides, bringing the compiler and benchmarking expertise of the
Segfault team directly into the Tarides organisation.

KC Sivaramakrishnan, CEO & CTO of Segfault Systems says that “Segfault Systems
was founded to secure the foundations of scalable systems programming in OCaml.
We have [successfully incorporated](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10831)
cutting-edge research on
[concurrent](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453483.3454039) and
[parallel](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408995) programming into OCaml. This
addresses the long-standing need of OCaml developers to utilise the widely
available multicore processing on modern machines. Tarides is at the forefront
of OCaml developer tooling and platform support, and we are excited to join the
team to make OCaml the best tool for industrial-strength concurrent and parallel
programming.”

“We’re thrilled to have the Segfault Systems team join Tarides,” says Thomas
Gazagnaire, CTO of Tarides. “They have been integral to the success of the
Multicore OCaml project, which has combined cutting edge research and
engineering with consistent communication, promoting Multicore OCaml as an
upstream candidate to the core developer team, as well as [publishing monthly
reports](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) for the wider
community. We look forward to working with our new partners to make OCaml the
tool of choice for developers.”

All of Segfault Systems’ existing responsibilities and open-source commitments
will migrate over to Tarides, where work will continue towards the three main
objectives in 2022: 

* Releasing OCaml 5.0 with support for domains and effect handlers
* Supporting the ecosystem to migrate the OCaml community over to OCaml 5.0 
* Improving developer productivity for OCaml 5.0 by releasing the best platform
  tools

Read the full announcement [here](), including details of our goals and the focus
for 2022. This alliance brings the headcount of Tarides up to 60+ people, all
working towards making OCaml the best language for any and every project.
